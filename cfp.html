      <h2>Workshop Theme and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        We aim FLute to be an interdisciplinary forum beyond publications' solicitation that brings together academia and industry. Notably, we seek to bring together researchers and practitioners whose work lies across different IEEE Societies, as well as ML & AI, Social sciences, Philosophy, Law, and others. Workshop organizers are actively engaged in the aforementioned themes and will encourage their network of colleagues and students to participate in the workshop. In particular, the goal of this workshop is to collaboratively:
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluate the socio-technical progression and obstacles in Federated Learning (FL) within different applications in the audio domain.</li>
          <li>Chart ethical dimensions and potentials of FL, with emphasis on governance, training methods, and design choices.</li>
          <li>Conceptualize novel data gathering and training frameworks in FL to balance privacy with data integrity across various devices.</li>
          <li>Investigating advanced techniques to fortify model dependability and data protection in audio processing.</li>
          <li>Initiating dialogues on the future of "Audio FL" and jointly developing strategic research agendas.</li>
          <li>Building a global community to propel these initiatives, fostering collaborations via research and funding proposals.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <p>
          The workshop aims to provide a platform for exchanging ideas on the future of federated learning surrounding audio applications. The main topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

      </li>
  </ul>


        <p>We encourage submissions from a wide range of disciplines, including machine learning, human-computer interaction, health data science, and related fields.</p>

        <h2>Submission
        details</h2>
        <p>
          We will have two types of submissions: archival and non-archival. Archival submissions will adhere to the main conference guidelines, while non-archival submissions will be extended abstracts, with a maximum length of two pages including references.

          Submissions will be reviewed by at least two or three reviewers, including organizers and external reviewers. Accepted archival submissions will be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

          Our acceptance criteria will include relevance, novelty, provocativeness, and research quality. Given the timely theme of this workshop, we are confident in attracting a significant number of high-quality paper submissions.

          Additionally, we will present a <b>Best Paper award</b>.

        </p>

      <p><strong>Exact submission instructions will be disclosed closer to the deadline. Please continue following this page for updated instructions.</strong>
        <!-- Any
        questions should be mailed to <a href="mailto:hcrlaaai@googlegroups.com">hcrlaaai@googlegroups.com</a>. -->
      </p>

      <h2>Attendance</h2>
      <p>We plan for an <strong>open, full-day workshop</strong> <strong>with 2 invited keynotes and accepted papers</strong> that include completed and ongoing original empirical works, case studies, reviews, as well as position papers (subject to number of submissions). All papers will be presented as talks, including Q&amp;A to allow researchers to engage in discussion with the workshop attendees.</p>
      <p>To further engage workshop participants, <em>workshopname</em> will include two interactive activities:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>a tiny tutorial, where participants will get a chance to play with state-of-the-art federated learning frameworks on a toy project;</li>
          <li>and an interactive panel on <em>"Challenges and opportunities of federated learning for Audio Understanding"</em> with keynote speakers and industry experts to further discuss reflections on their work with an open Q&amp;A session with the audience, moderated by one of the co-organizers.</li>
      </ul>
